## âž• Adding a new icon

To find and add a new icon:

1. Search [Material Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/) for the icon you need and download it. Alternatively, in Figma, use the Material Design Icons plugin to add the icon to a page then export the icon as SVG
2. Add the icon to the NDS design system `Icons` page in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/IH4gk9P2E4xEYiNKoD22Jd/NDS-v1?node-id=113-851)
3. Clone this repo (`git clone git@github.com:nulogy/nds-icons.git`)
4. Place SVG in `assets/` folder with the desired icon name (in camelCase). The name of the icon should match the icon's name in Figma. Consult with the designer what the desired name should be, otherwise use the name provided in Material Icons
5. Commit the changes using a [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) message
6. Submit PR
