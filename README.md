# @nulogy/icons

> This is a collection of Material Icons that are used by Nulogy applications. This package is already imported into the `<Icon />` component of the [@nulogy/components](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/tree/master/components), and the icons here can be chosen with the `icon` prop.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
